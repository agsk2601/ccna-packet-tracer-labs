# CCNA Packet Tracer Labs

This repository contains a collection of Packet Tracer (.pkt) projects I created while studying for the **Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) 200-301** exam.

Each project demonstrates hands-on configuration and simulation of key networking concepts using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## 🔧 Topics Covered

- ✅ Basic LAN Setup
- ✅ VLANs and Trunking
- ✅ Inter-VLAN Routing (Router-on-a-Stick)
- ✅ Static Routing
- ✅ RIPv2 Dynamic Routing
- ✅ DHCP Server Configuration
- ✅ NAT (PAT)
- ✅ HSRP (Redundant Gateway)
- ✅ WAN (PPP, Frame Relay)
- ✅ DNS, Web, and Email Server Integration
- ✅ Enterprise Network Design (3-tier model)

## 📁 File Structure

Each `.pkt` file represents a self-contained network simulation and includes:
- Topology design
- Device configuration (routers, switches, PCs)
- Testing/validation (ping, traceroute)

## 🧠 Goal

To reinforce foundational networking knowledge and prepare for real-world network design and troubleshooting tasks.
